```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Setup

Let's setup our required libraries for the data wrangling and plotting:

```{r libraries, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(devtools)

# Define packages to load
cran_pckgs <- c("here", "tidyverse", "magrittr", "DT", "ggthemes", "scales",
                "knitr")

# Install them if not on the system
# install.packages(pkgs = pckgs, dependencies = TRUE) # CRAN
devtools::install_github("hadley/emo") # EMOJI package

# Load all packages
# Source: https://blog.mitchelloharawild.com/blog/loading-r-packages-in-a-loop/
for(pkg in cran_pckgs){
  eval(bquote(library(.(pkg))))
}
```

We will mainly need `tidyverse` and
`magrittr` (for ye old piping) for this exercise. The `ggthemes` package will
be used to define the fivethirtyeight theme. In order to load the libraries
in a clean simple loop, we will use Mitchell O'Hara-Wild's [convenient script](https://blog.mitchelloharawild.com/blog/loading-r-packages-in-a-loop/)
`r emo::ji("sunglasses")`.


## Recreating the Bob Ross chart from Fivethirtyeight

We will attempt to reproduce the Bob Ross barplot from [this fascinating fivethirtyeight article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-statistical-analysis-of-the-work-of-bob-ross/) by the author [Walt Hickey](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/walt-hickey/). Specifically
this is the [chart](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hickey-ross-tags-1.png?w=1150) we will be reproducing from the article:

![](`r "https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hickey-ross-tags-1.png?w=1150"`)


We will be using the data kindly provided by the author [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bob-ross). Let's get cracking `r emo::ji("muscle")`.

## Acknowledgments

As always thanks to fivethirtyeight for creating such fantastic graphics to learn from and for doing the heavy lifting in obtaining and kindly providing the [underlying data and code](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data) for exploratory purposes. I've only used their data here and not looked at any code
provided to enhance my own learning of `ggplot2` and `R` which is the 
very point of this post `r emo::ji("smile")`.

### Data Load and Processing

Note we can download the data directly from the [raw source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/bob-ross/elements-by-episode.csv) or from local file we have saved in our submodule clone
of the fivethirtyeight github repo. We will go with the latter option as
we already have the data loaded and will save us unnecessary server calls to 
github when re-running the code.

```{r data_load, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}
# OPTION 1 - Download raw data directly from source
# ross_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/bob-ross/elements-by-episode.csv"
# ross_dat <- readr::read_csv(file = ross_url)

# OPTION 2 - Load data from our local directory (submodule)
core_dat_dir <- here::here("submods", "data", "bob-ross")
ross_dat <- readr::read_csv(file = file.path(core_dat_dir,
                                             "elements-by-episode.csv"))
# dir.exists(core_dat_dir) # Just checking that the data dir is valid
# dplyr::glimpse(ross_dat)
# ross_dat %>% 
    # DT::datatable(data = .)    
```

Interesting, so we have seem to have a unique episode identifier and associated title and then 67 indicator variables of features related to
Bob Ross' paintings e.g. `BOAT` being 1 presumably indicates that there
was a painting of a boat for that particular episode.

### Tidying the data

Let's keep the top 20 tags sorted in desceding order:

```{r tidying_data, cache=TRUE}
ross_tidy <- ross_dat %>% 
                tidyr::gather(data = ., key = tag, value = indicator, APPLE_FRAME:WOOD_FRAMED)

# Helper function to convert strings to Title case replacing underscores with
# spaces and trimming appropriately
new_tag_fmt <- function(str){
    stringr::str_replace_all(string = str, pattern = "_", 
                             replacement = " ") %>% 
        stringr::str_trim() %>%
        stringr::str_to_title() %>% 
        base::return()
}

tot_episodes <- ross_tidy %>% dplyr::select(EPISODE) %>% dplyr::n_distinct()
ross_tidy2 <- ross_tidy %>% 
                dplyr::group_by(tag) %>% 
                dplyr::summarize(total = sum(indicator)) %>%
                dplyr::ungroup() %>% 
                dplyr::mutate(tag = base::as.factor(new_tag_fmt(str = tag)),
                              perc = base::round(total/tot_episodes, 2),
                              perc_fmt = scales::percent(perc)) %>%
                dplyr::arrange(desc(total)) %>% 
                dplyr::filter(total >= 5)
# DT::datatable(ross_tidy2)
```

### Creating the plot

So this plot took a lot of adjustments to make. As it can be seen below there
are more improvements to make but the general idea seems fine. I did reach out
to stackoverflow to understand an issue I was having with positioning and the
barwidth. The issue is still not quite resolved though I'm very open to suggestions and improvements `r emo::ji("help")`.

```{r creating_plot, cache=TRUE}
ross_tidy2 %>% 
    ggplot2::ggplot(data = ., aes(x = reorder(tag, perc), y = perc)) +
    ggplot2::geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#198DD1",
                      position = position_dodge(width = 0.7)) +
    ggplot2::coord_flip() +
    ggplot2::labs(title = "The Paintings of Bob Ross",
                  subtitle = "Percentage containing each element") +
    ggplot2::geom_text(data = ross_tidy2, nudge_y = 0.02, angle = 270,
                           aes(reorder(tag, total), y = perc, label = perc_fmt),
                       family = "Courier", color = "#3E3E3E") +
    ggthemes::scale_color_fivethirtyeight("cyl") +
    ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight() +
    ggplot2::theme(panel.border = element_blank(), 
                   panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
                   panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
                   axis.line = element_blank(),
                   axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
                   axis.text.x = element_blank(),
                   plot.title = element_text(size = 18, hjust=-0.5),
                   plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14, hjust=-0.5),
                   axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10))
```

### Issues and Improvements

The following could clearly be improved:

* Getting access to the full `tag` data from the author would be awesome. This
would then match the more granular y-axis labels in line with the article rather
than the summary tags provided. Unlike the author I don't have the stamina to
autotag all of the episodes, though that would be a good validation of the 
source data.
* I would like to have the plot vertically enlarged i.e. stretched, much like
the source graphic. *Does anyone have any idea how to make this happen to make
it resemble the actual chart (which may not be produced only using `ggplot2`?*.
The percentage values are not really legible and I can't adjust the bar width
and bar position to be dodged at the same time.

### Verdict - Success or Failure

So what's the verdict - Success or Failure? *Not a complete failure* but needs more work per the improvements above.

### Optional - Extract All R code chunks

We can extract all of the `R` code only from the above script using the
`knitr::purl` command which I learnt from this [neat blog post](http://felixfan.github.io/extract-r-code/).
