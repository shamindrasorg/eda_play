## Histogram of Numerous Dice Rolls

There has been a very cool dice roll simulation 
going around on twitter/ reddit as shown below:

We can find the original `reddit` post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/au25nq/simulating_6000_die_rolls_visualization_created/).

## How to simulate this in `R`

The author provides a nice long looped implementation of the
underlying data and the animation construction using `Imagemagick`.

However awesome `R` educator and statistician David Robinson provided
a `tidyverse` and `gganimate` solution [here](https://gist.github.com/dgrtwo/d590078aae86e24418a7cf5a9fb31ae3), pasted below:

```{r drob_soln, cache=TRUE}
# Setup
options(gganimate.nframes = 200)
set.seed(2019)

simulation <- tibble(roll = 1:10000) %>%
  mutate(result = sample(6, n(), replace = TRUE)) %>%
  crossing(nrolls = seq(10, 10000, 10)) %>%
  filter(roll <= nrolls) %>%
  count(nrolls, result)

ggplot(simulation, aes(result, n, fill = factor(result))) +
  geom_col(position = "identity", show.legend = FALSE) +
  transition_manual(nrolls) +
  view_follow() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:6) +
  labs(y = "# of rolls with this result",
       title = "Distribution of results after { current_frame } rolls of a six-sided die")
```

This is an amazingly beautiful solution! Let's learn from it by understanding
the key steps.

## Understanding drob's solution

The high level strategy is simple
